Hi! My name is a Caleb Pennington and I'm a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Statistics with Minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. On this GitHub page, you can find some of my favorite projects that I've worked on throughout college! For the purpose of maintaing academic integrity, some the projects I've worked on are private but if you are not a student at Penn and are interested in seeing my work, please send an email to cpenn@wharton.upenn.edu. Thanks!
